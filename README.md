A simple tic-tac-toe game developed with the SFML Library with two options 
1. play against another person
2. play against an ai
- you can never win the ai, only lose or forse a tie.
- the ai was developed with the mini-max algorthim and the purpose of the project was to practice how to implement the algorithm.
